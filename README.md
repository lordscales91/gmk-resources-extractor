Usage
----
	python launch.py <data.win> [output_dir]

*&lt;data.win&gt;* refers to the main resource file usually called with this name.


*[output_dir]* Optional base directory for the recovered resources, it defaults to "data"

Progress
----
This is the very first commit, at this point the only resources the program can recover are the audio files, I will be adding support for more resources soon starting with the textures.
